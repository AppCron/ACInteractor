## Current Status

## Overview
ACIntactor is a Swift Package that supports a use case centric architecture in Swift projects.

### License
[Apache License, Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

## Setup
Since Swift 3 and Swift Package are not available with an stable Xcode release, just add the Files of the **Sources** folder to your project.

### via Git Submodule
At the moment I recommend adding the entire ACInteractor project as a [Git Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to your repository.

0. Navigate to the root directory of your Git repository in Terminal.
0. Run the following command:  
  ```
  git submodule add https://github.com/AppCron/ACInteractor.git
  ```
0. Add the files of the **Sources** folder to your project.

### via Download
Alternativly you can just download the files directly from Github and add the files of the *Sources* folder to your project.
